# leet-code-solutions
A repository containing my solutions to leetcode questions. 

## Comments
I sometimes write notes about what I thought about the problem solving process for these questions. I find that writing
my internal monologue helps a lot with the thought process. In addition I include things I think I can improve on, impressions
on problems, etc.
